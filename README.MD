# DESCRIPTION 
Implement various vector math functions without using third-party math libraries and loops.
Basically this project is about to develop a math library with custom made linear algebra funtions
to do basic vectors operation, like Add, Sum, Sub, Multiply, Dot, Mean and Magnitude.


## PROCESS
	All the funtions are grouped in the linear_algebra.py file, and the testing file cointaining 
	the code to test those funtions is linear_algebra_test.py. which is run on nosetesting platform.
